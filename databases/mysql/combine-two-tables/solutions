1) use simple left join:
    select t1.FirstName, t1.LastName, t2.City, t2.State from Person as t1 left join Address as t2 on t1.PersonId = t2.PersonId;

2) because there is no same column name in two tables, so alias name can be ommited:
    SELECT FirstName, LastName, City, State
    FROM Person
    LEFT JOIN Address
    ON Person.PersonId = Address.PersonId;

3) left join using:
    SELECT FirstName, LastName, City, State
    FROM Person
    LEFT JOIN Address
    USING(PersonId);

4) natural left join:
    SELECT FirstName, LastName, City, State
    FROM Person
    NATURAL LEFT JOIN Address;
